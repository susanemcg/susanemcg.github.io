Through countless conversations, workshops, interviews and experiments, this book is my effort to make essential information security expertise accessible to any newsroom or journalist. Though the legal context is US-centric, most of the principles and practices in this book - from compartmentalizing social media accounts to minimizing the data on your daily devices - is applicable to media professionals, academics and anyone who wants to understand and take better control of their digital information.
